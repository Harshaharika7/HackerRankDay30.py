# 📘 Day 30: Queues and Performance | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

-This repository contains the Python solution for Day 30, the final challenge of HackerRank’s 30 Days of Code using Python 3.

-This problem emphasizes efficient queue simulation and tracking based on priority and order.

# 🚀 Challenge Summary

-Simulate a real-world print queue where tasks are printed based on priority, not just position.

-Determine how long it takes for a specific task (indexed by m) to be completed.

# 📝 Problem Statement

-A queue of documents with their priorities

-The index of your document

-Determine when your document gets printed, considering the printer always prints the document with the highest priority.

# ✅ Constraints

      -1 ≤ n ≤ 100
      
      -1 ≤ priority ≤ 9

# 🔢 Sample Input
        
        6 2
        1 1 9 1 1 1

# ✅ Sample Output

        5

# 💡 Explanation

The document at index 2 (priority 9) is printed first even if it’s 3rd in line — because priority rules over order.

# 🧠 Concepts Practiced

-Queue simulation

-Priority-based task execution

-Python deque and enumerate

-Time complexity awareness

-Real-world scenario modeling

# 🛠 How to Run

Option 1: With input file

        python3 bitwise_and.py < input.txt1
        
        python3 bitwise_and.py < input.txt2

Option 2: Manual input

        python3 bitwise_and.py
