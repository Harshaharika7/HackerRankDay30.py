📘 Day 30: Queues and Performance | HackerRank 30 Days of Code
This repository contains the Python solution for Day 30, the final challenge of HackerRank’s 30 Days of Code using Python 3. This problem emphasizes efficient queue simulation and tracking based on priority and order.

🚀 Challenge Summary
Simulate a real-world print queue where tasks are printed based on priority, not just position.
Determine how long it takes for a specific task (indexed by m) to be completed.

📝 Problem Statement
Given:

A queue of documents with their priorities

The index of your document
Determine when your document gets printed, considering the printer always prints the document with the highest priority.

✅ Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 100

1 ≤ priority ≤ 9

🔢 Sample Input
Copy code
6 2
1 1 9 1 1 1
✅ Sample Output
Copy code
5
💡 Explanation
The document at index 2 (priority 9) is printed first even if it’s 3rd in line — because priority rules over order.

🧠 Concepts Practiced
Queue simulation

Priority-based task execution

Python deque and enumerate

Time complexity awareness

Real-world scenario modeling

🛠 How to Run
bash
Copy code
python3 print_queue.py
Provide input as prompted or redirect from an input file.
